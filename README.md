1. Define your dataset and change its source in `reduccion.py `

```python
  carpeta = f'{current_dir}/DATASET-UNCINARIAS'
```

2. Run `setup_directories` with the name of a new folder `<MY-TEST-FOLDER>`. This folder will be created in `__tests` and contain an structure to save the data generated in each step.

```python
./setup_directories.py <MY-TEST-FOLDER>
```

3. Finally run next command. By default, the generated model will be in `__tests/<MY-TEST-FOLDER>/GENERATED_MODELS`

```python
python3 run_all.py ./__tests/<MY-TEST-FOLDER>
```
